        <h4>Clapping a Switch Using Ic</h4>
        <p>
        	A clap switch is an electronic circuit, which controls electrical appliances with user clapping sound.
        	It is an advantageous technology for mobility impaired persons.
            This project involves constructing a clapping switch using an integrated circuit(IC). The clapping sound serve as an input trigger,and the IC processes this input to control a switch.
             This switch can control devices such as lights or appliances.
            This ICâ€™s circuitry detects the clapping sound and converts it into a signal that toggles the switch ON or OFF, Providing a hands-free way to control connected devices.
